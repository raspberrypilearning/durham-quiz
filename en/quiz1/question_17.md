legend: Question 17 of 24

You use this script to control what happens when a sprite touches a button:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
if <touching [up button v]> then
change y by (10)
end
if <touching [down button v]> then
change y by (-10)
```

Which block would you use to `change y by ()`{:class='block3motion'} `1` at all other times?

legend: Question 2 of 24
---

A project has this script to `ask`{:class="block3sensing"} the user for their name:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
set [name v] to [???] 
ask [What's your name?] and wait 
set [name v] to (answer)
```

What will be the value of the `name`{:class="block3variables"} variable after the player clicks on the tick (checkmark) and the script finishes?

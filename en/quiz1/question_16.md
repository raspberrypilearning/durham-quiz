legend: Question 16 of 24
---

You use this script to control what happens when the player clicks on a sprite:

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
if <(score)>  [10]> then 
say [Level 2 activated!] for [2] seconds 
else
say [Still on Level 1!] for [2] seconds 
end
```

If the value of the `score`{:class="block3variables"} variable is `9`, what will happen when the player clicks on the sprite?

--- choices ---

- ( ) The sprite will `say`{:class="block3looks"} `Level 2 activated!`

- (x) The sprite will `say`{:class="block3looks"} `Still on Level 1!`

- ( ) The `score`{:class="block3variables"} variable will be set to 10

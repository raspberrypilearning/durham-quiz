legend: Question 16 of 24
---

Here is a Scratch script.

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
if <(score)> [10]> then 
say [Yes!] for [2] seconds 
else 
if <(score)> [100]> then 
say [Wow!] for [2] seconds 
end
end
```

If the value of the `score`{:class="block3variables"} variable is `150`, what will happen when the player clicks on the sprite?

--- choices ---

- (x) The sprite will `say`{:class="block3looks"} `Yes!`

- ( ) The sprite will `say`{:class="block3looks"} `Wow!`

- ( ) The `score`{:class="block3variables"} variable will be set to `100`
